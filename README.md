# project description
## problem and solution
The LabDAO is an online community of scientists and engineers that care about building open tools to accelerate progress in biomedicine. Just like with every other scientific lab, our **web-lab** community loves talking about science - so we started setting up this weekly lab-meeting! This meeting takes inspiration from the MIA meetings at the Broad. Over time we might also switch to a two-speaker format, where a primer is followed by a scientific talk.

## technology
* twitter to announce events and invite speakers
* google forms to collect submissions via the community@labdao.com profile
* zoom to host lab meetings and record them
* youtube to share recordings
